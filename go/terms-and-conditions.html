    <h1 class="mt-5 text-center">Uptime.com Terms &amp; Conditions</h1>
<hr class="my-5 bg-success w-25">
<div class="container bg-white my-5">

  <p>Capitalized words in these Service Terms have special meanings given in the Section where they are first used or in Section 11 (<em>Definitions)</em>.</p>
  <p>Uptime.com may modify these Services Terms at any time, but modifications are not effective for Orders that are in place prior to the modification until the Order renews or Customer adds new Services for the monitored Web Application. See Section 10.20(<em>Changes to Online Service Terms).</em></p>
  <p><strong>1. SERVICES</strong>. Uptime.com agrees to provide Services for the Term on the terms and conditions stated in the Order and these Service Terms. Uptime.com makes the following commitments:</p>
  <p><strong>1.1 Services</strong>. The Services will include those features listed in Customer&rsquo;s Order and related graphical user interfaces and application programming interfaces. Uptime.com will update the Services without additional charge so that they remain consistent with its generally available current offering that corresponds to the Services purchased.</p>
  <p><strong>1.2 Warranties</strong>. Uptime.com warrants that (i) the Services will conform in all material respects with the description of the Services stated in the Order and with its general release user Documentation, and (ii) if Customer has configured the Services in accordance with the Documentation for a &ldquo;best case build&rdquo; or &ldquo;common practice build&rdquo; the data returned by the Services will be materially accurate (the &ldquo;<strong>Services Warranty</strong>&rdquo;). Uptime.com warrants that it will provide the Services in compliance with the laws applicable to the provision of the Services.</p>
  <p><strong>1.3 Support</strong>. Uptime.com will publish support Documentation online on its Site. Uptime.com will provide live technical assistance via email, ticket, telephone and chat during its standard support hours. Uptime.com&rsquo;s standard support hours are published on its Site and may vary, but are currently 6:00 a.m. &ndash; 6:00 p.m. United States Central Time, Monday &ndash; Friday, excluding federal public holidays in the United States and Uptime.com announced support holidays. Uptime.com offers urgent issue support 24 x 7, but Customer must designate an off-hours support request as &ldquo;emergency&rdquo; or &ldquo;urgent&rdquo; to receive a response during off-hours.</p>
  <p><strong>1.4 Evaluation Use of the Services</strong>. Uptime.com may provide Customer with access to its Services for Customer&rsquo;s use in evaluating the Services for a potential purchase. Notwithstanding anything in the contrary in the Agreement, Services provided on an evaluation basis, whether provided at no charge or for a fee, are provided&nbsp;<strong>AS IS</strong>, without any service commitments, warranties or representations whatsoever. Uptime.com has no obligation to provide support for any evaluation services. Any support that is provided is provided on an&nbsp;<strong>AS IS</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>AS AVAILABLE</strong>&nbsp;basis. Uptime.com has no liability for any harm or damage arising out of or in connection with Customer&rsquo;s use of the services during any evaluation period.</p>
  <p><strong>2. CUSTOMER INFORMATION</strong>. &ldquo;<strong>Customer Information</strong>&rdquo; is any data or information that Customer submits to Uptime.com in connection with the Uptime.com Services account or that is created or accessed by Customer or Uptime.com by means of the Uptime.com Services. Customer Information consists solely of: (i) information submitted to Uptime.com to establish a Services account, receive support, and use the Services, such as business contact information of Customer&rsquo;s personnel, payment information, and content of support requests, and (ii) data or information collected by means of the Services. Unless Customer elects to install Uptime.com&rsquo;s code snippet on the Customer&rsquo;s Web server, the only information collected by Uptime.com by means of the Services is information that is generally available to any public user of the Customer&rsquo;s monitored Web Application(s). If Customer elects to install Uptime.com&rsquo;s code snippet on its Web server, then the Uptime.com Service may also capture information that is captured by Web servers generally, such as visitor IP address, date and time of visit, and duration of visit. Customer Information is Customer&rsquo;s Confidential Information covered by Section 10.3 (<em>Confidential Information</em>). As between Customer and Uptime.com, Customer owns and retains ownership and all rights in Customer Information and Uptime.com may use Customer Information only for the purpose of providing the Services, communicating with Customer and administering the Customer&rsquo;s account, exercising its legal rights and remedies in connection with the Agreement, and as otherwise expressly permitted by Section 10.3 (<em>Confidential Information</em>).

Uptime.com may use system generated data for insights to help it improve general support and service. Customer authorizes Uptime.com to de-identify and aggregate Customer Information with similar de-identified data of other customers and with anonymous data from public or private data sets and analyze the resulting data sets for insights to help it improve its services generally, provided that Uptime.com&rsquo;s method of de-identification must make it technically infeasible for any data to be re-identified to any of Customer&rsquo;s customers or to Customer.</p>
  <p><strong>3. SECURITY AND PRIVACY</strong>.</p>
  <p><strong>3.1 Security</strong>. On Customer&rsquo;s request, Uptime.com will provide a description of the security measures it uses to protect Customer Information (the &ldquo;<strong>Security Materials</strong>&rdquo;).&nbsp;<strong>Uptime.com</strong>&nbsp;will protect Customer Information using measures at least as stringent as those stated in the Security Materials for the Term and following the Term for so long as Uptime.com retains any Customer Information. Customer acknowledges that Uptime.com cannot guarantee complete security and that there is always a security risk involved in the use of an online service. Customer acknowledges that the measures described in the Security materials are reasonable and appropriate given the nature of the Customer Information and agrees that Uptime.com is not responsible to Customer for any harm Customer suffers as a result of a security breach unless the breach resulted from Uptime.com&rsquo;s failure to maintain the security measures described in this Security Materials. Customer acknowledges that the Security Materials are Uptime.com&rsquo;s sensitive Confidential Information covered by the restrictions on use and disclosure stated in Section 10.3 (<em>Confidential Information</em>).</p>
  <p><strong>3.2 Privacy</strong>. Customer Information includes Personal Data as follows: (i) business contact information and Uptime.com log in credentials of Customer&rsquo;s personnel and their interactions with the Uptime.com application or support portal; (ii) information volunteered by Customer&rsquo;s personnel as part of a support request or other communication, and (iii) if Customer elects to install the Uptime.com code snippet on its Web server, the IP address of visitors to the monitored Web Application and other data about their visit that is captured by Web servers generally, such as date and time of visit and duration of visit. Uptime.com makes the following commitments with respect to Customer&rsquo;s Personal Data: (i) Uptime.com will provide Customer with access to the Personal Data as necessary for Customer to comply with applicable legal requirements for access, destruction, or modification of the Personal Data at the request of a data subject; and (ii) Uptime.com will notify Customer in writing without undue delay if it discovers that any Personal Data has been accessed, used, disclosed, destroyed, or corrupted other than as permitted by the Agreement, will provide all information reasonably available to it regarding the reported event, will cooperate with Customer&rsquo;s reasonable requests to mitigate and remediate the event. Customer acknowledges and agrees that Uptime.com affiliates and services suppliers may be based outside of the geographic jurisdiction in which Customer&rsquo;s data subjects are located. If legally required the parties will enter into good faith negotiations for such agreements as are necessary for the transfer of the personal data across national borders.</p>

  <p>The Uptime.com mobile applications and any API or other software or computer instructions that Uptime.com provides for Customer&rsquo;s use on a Customer system or device are licensed to Customer on a non-exclusive, limited term basis for Customer&rsquo;s use only in connection with the Uptime.com Services as permitted by the Agreement, and subject to all of the restrictions and conditions stated in the Agreement. Uptime.com may modify its API(s) from time to time .</p>
  <p><strong>5. INTEGRATION FEATURES</strong></p>
  <p>The Services include integration features for third-party services such as Slack, PagerDuty, and other communications services and tools. Customer acknowledges that Uptime.com&rsquo;s integration features may be unavailable or may not work properly if the service provider&rsquo;s API is unavailable or if the service provider modifies its API or services in a way that impacts the Uptime.com integration feature. Uptime.com will use commercially reasonable efforts to modify its integration features to maintain compatibility with service provider&rsquo;s APIs and services but may discontinue an integration feature without liability to Customer if there is a change in the service that creates an unreasonable cost or operational burden to Uptime.com. Customer&rsquo;s obligations under the Agreement, for fees and otherwise, are not conditioned on the continued availability of any integration features.</p>
  <p><strong>6. FEES AND PAYMENTS</strong></p>
  <p><strong>6.1 Fees</strong>. Uptime.com&rsquo;s fees may be fixed amounts or rate-based usage charges. The initial fees are established by the Order and Uptime.com may charge the fees at the times stated in the Order.

  <p><strong>6.4 Late Payments</strong>. Uptime.com may suspend or terminate Customer&rsquo;s Services or the Agreement if Customer&rsquo;s payment is overdue, including if Uptime.com&rsquo;s charge to Customer&rsquo;s payment card or account is rejected.

  <p><strong>7.1 Web Application</strong>. Customer will use the Services only to monitor the Web Application(s) identified in the Order.</p>

  <p><strong>8.2 Termination</strong>. Either party may terminate an Order or any or all Orders between the parties, on written notice if the other party is in material violation of any term of an Order or these Service Terms, provided that if the violation is curable the terminating party must first give the other party a written notice describing the violation in reasonable detail and at least ten (10) days to cure the violation.</p>
  <p><strong>8.3 Suspension</strong>. Uptime.com may suspend Customer&rsquo;s access to the Services and Customer Information during any period that Customer is in material breach of the Agreement or Customer&rsquo;s access to the Services or Customer Information creates a material security vulnerability. Uptime.com will give Customer at least two (2) business days&rsquo; advance notice of the suspension unless the suspension is made under emergency circumstances.

  <p><strong>9. REMEDIES, DISCLAIMERS, INDEMNIFICATION, LIMITATIONS</strong></p>
  <p><strong>9.1 Warranty Remedy</strong>. If Uptime.com fails to meet the Service Warranty, Uptime.com will attempt to cure the failure or if it is unable to cure the failure through commercially reasonable efforts will refund the fees paid for the month during which the failure occurred.

The remedies stated in this Section are Customer&rsquo;s&nbsp;<strong>sole and exclusive</strong>&nbsp;remedy for Uptime.com&rsquo;s breach of the Services Warranty.</p>
  <p><strong>9.2 No Other Warranty.</strong>&nbsp;Except as expressly stated in these Services Terms or an SLA, the Services are provided&nbsp;<strong>AS IS. Uptime.com disclaims any implied warranties, such as a warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement, and any representation or warranty that may arise through a course of dealing. Customer acknowledges that the use of the Service may not be uninterrupted, error free, or completely secure.</strong>&nbsp;Customer represents that Customer has not relied on any representation or warranty other than those stated in these Services Terms.</p>
  <p><strong>9.3 Indemnification</strong>. Uptime.com shall defend Customer and its affiliates, and each of their respective employees, directors, members, managers, officers, owners, and agents (collectively the &ldquo;<strong>Customer Indemnitees&rdquo;) from any third-party claim asserting that Customer&rsquo;s use of the Services as permitted by the Agreement infringes or misappropriates the copyright, patent, trade secret or other intellectual property right of the third party recognized in the United States (either under direct United States law or pursuant to an international treaty to which the United States is a party) (an &ldquo;IP Claim</strong>&rdquo;) and pay any resulting liability, judgment, loss, damage, cost and other expense (including reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees) (&ldquo;<strong>Losses</strong>&rdquo;) awarded to the third party by a court of competent jurisdiction, or in the alternative shall settle the IP Claim at Uptime.com&rsquo;s expense, provided that Customer&rsquo;s consent is required if the settlement does not fully resolve the IP Claim or requires Uptime.com or any Customer Indemnitee to make a statement admitting culpability. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Uptime.com shall not have any obligation to indemnify an IP Claim to the extent it results from (i) an unauthorized modification of the Services by any of the Customer Indemnitees or persons acting on their instruction, or (ii) an unauthorized combination or use of the Services by any of the Customer Indemnitees or persons acting on their instruction with any software, hardware or other technology, information or materials not provided by Uptime.com unless the combination or use is reasonably contemplated by the nature of the Services or their authorized use. If an IP Claim is asserted, or in Uptime.com&rsquo;s reasonable opinion is reasonably probable of assertion, Uptime.com may terminate the Agreement without liability except to refund prepaid fees for unused Services, provided that Uptime.com must first have used commercially reasonable efforts to resolve the IP Claim or modify the Services to avoid the IP Claim without material diminishment of functionality. This Section states Customer&rsquo;s sole and exclusive remedies and Uptime.com sole and exclusive obligations with respect to claims of intellectual property infringement.</p>
  <p><strong>9.4 Limitation of Liability.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>9.4.1 No Consequential, Indirect Damages. Except for claims arising from a party&rsquo;s breach of Section 10.3 (<em>Confidential Information</em>), or claims based on the party&rsquo;s intentional breach of the other party&rsquo;s intellectual property rights, neither party nor its affiliates, licensors, suppliers, resellers, distributors or subcontractors is liable to the other for any lost profits, lost revenue, lost business opportunity, or any indirect, special, incidental, punitive, or consequential loss or damage of any kind arising in connection with this Agreement, or any loss or damage that could have been avoided by the claiming party&rsquo;s reasonable mitigation, even if the party has been advised of or should be aware of the possibility of such damages</strong>.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, excluding: (i) claims arising from a party&rsquo;s gross negligence, recklessness, or intentional tort, (ii) claims arising from a party&rsquo;s breach of Section 10.3 (<em>Confidential Information</em>), (iii) claims based on the party&rsquo;s intentional infringement or misappropriation of the other party&rsquo;s intellectual property rights, and (iv) payment obligations under Section 6 (<em>Fees and Payments</em>), the maximum aggregate liability of a party and its affiliates, licensors, suppliers, resellers, distributors, and subcontractors under or in connection with this Agreement for any type of damages, claims or obligations shall not exceed the amount of fees paid or payable by Customer under the Order giving rise to the claim for the 12 months preceding the event giving rise to the claim.</strong>&nbsp;For clarity, the maximum aggregate monetary limit stated in this subsection is not &ldquo;per incident&rdquo; but is an aggregate limitation applicable to all claims arising under or regarding this Agreement.</p>
  <p><strong>9.4.3 General</strong>. Customer acknowledges that Uptime.com has set its fees and entered into the Order in reliance on the limitations of remedies and liability stated in these Terms, and that these limitations reflect an agreed allocation of risk between Customer and Uptime.com .

Each party agrees not to disclose the other party&rsquo;s Confidential Information to any third person except as follows: (i) to the party&rsquo;s respective service providers, agents and representatives, provided that such service providers, agents or representatives are bound by written confidentiality measures that are at least as stringent as these terms; (ii) in response to a subpoena or other compulsory legal process, provided that each party agrees to give the other advance written notice of at least seven (7) days prior to disclosing the other party&rsquo;s Confidential Information under this subparagraph (or prompt notice in advance of disclosure, if seven (7) days advance notice is not reasonably feasible), unless the law or a reasonable interpretation of it, forbids such notice, or (iii) as otherwise expressly permitted by the Agreement. On expiration or earlier termination of the Agreement, each party will return or destroy the other party&rsquo;s Confidential Information. If a party believes it is not feasible to completely destroy the other party&rsquo;s Confidential Information as required by this Section, it will give the other party written notice describing the Confidential Information and the circumstances that make destruction infeasible. All Confidential Information retained by each party following termination of the Agreement remains subject to the requirements of this Section. Each party will use commercially reasonable care to safeguard the other&rsquo;s Confidential Information.
