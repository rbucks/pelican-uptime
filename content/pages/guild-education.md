        Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        88 million working adults need upskilling or reskilling to compete in the
        future of work.    <a href="https://www.guildeducation.com/" rel="noopener">Guild's</a>
        mission is to unlock opportunity for America’s workforce through education,
        with a double-bottom line business model that does well by doing good.

      <h2>
        Guild Needed a Customer-Facing Perspective
      </h2>
      <p>
        Guild runs a variety of educational experiences, which require round the
        clock connectivity. “We did, and do, have other monitoring solutions,” says
        Quentin Hartman, director of DevOps and Engineering for Guild Education.
        “Fundamentally though, none of them looked at our sites from the outside as
        a user would see them, and we thought it was important to add that
        perspective to our monitoring regime.”
      </p>
      <p>
        In evaluating monitoring solutions, Guild’s requirements were as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Improve visibility into the availability and performance of
          applications

        Seeking a robust and affordable solution, Guild Education partnered with
        Uptime.com.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Reliability and Intuitive Setup Were Critical for Guild Education
      </h2>
      <p>
        Guild primarily chose Uptime.com for the breadth of testing options and
        definitions. “Our teams were able to quickly and easily
        <a

        create tests
        </a>
        for a variety of services we rely on to do business, and be sure that the
        tests accurately reflected our status from the perspective of the Internet
        at large” said Quentin Hartman.

        Uptime.com Transaction checks
        </a>
        , Guild can monitor the status of login, dashboard interactions, and user
        interface elements from a single check.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Uptime.com provides an important correlation point in conjunction with our
        other monitoring tools so we can more easily tell if a problem exists
        within our infrastructure, or if there is a problem somewhere else that
        might be affecting reachability.”
      </p>
      <h2>
        Testing and Alerting are Much More Efficient
      </h2>
      <p>
        The Uptime.com transaction check tool provides advanced testing and
        automation with a much lower barrier for entry. As a result, Guild is able
        to construct a variety of tests with a high degree of detail and
        sophistication.
      </p>
      <p>
        “One of the circumstances that contributed to the adoption of Uptime.com
        was a case where a critical client was contacting us about their portal
        being unreachable, which was confusing to us because our internal checks
        all showed green. Turns out the problem was with changes that were being
        made on their side by mistake. With the help of Uptime.com, and configuring
        a more sophisticated check, we were able to detect the problem first,
        putting us into a much stronger position to support our client.”

        “We had a routine maintenance that involved running a script, which seemed
        reasonable and fine to run after testing, in order to automate some changes
        in production. Well, it was not fine! Turns out it was far too aggressive
        in the production environment and it was causing timeouts on the site.
        Uptime.com was the first tool to alert us to the problem, and within
        moments we were able to stop the script and restore service.” -Quentin
