                          <p style="font-size: 15px;">SocketLabs has spent 15 years perfecting the art and science of easy, reliable delivery for email. Regardless of company size or business complexity, their technology, reporting, and support resources maximize the success of email.</p>
                          <h3>Challenge</h3>
                          <p style="font-size: 15px;">Persistent false downtime alarms were impacting SocketLabs’ business operations and team morale. They needed to find a monitoring partner that combined reliability, usability, and product innovation to keep up with their uptime monitoring needs.</p>
                          <h3>Solution</h3>
                          <p style="font-size: 15px;">SocketLabs signed up for an Uptime.com 21-day free trial and immediately configured hundreds of SMTP, API, and Transaction checks within just 24 hours. They were also able to connect monitoring several integrations for evaluative purposes – quickly discovering that Uptime.com was the right uptime monitoring solution for them.</p>
                          <h3>Results</h3>
                          <p style="font-size: 15px;">Four years later, SocketLabs remains a happy Uptime.com customer that utilizes virtually every tool in Uptime.com’s monitoring solution. This includes basic and advanced checks, alert escalations, scheduled reports, status pages, private locations, and integrations.</p>

                          <h2>Introduction</h2>
                          <p><span>Founded 15 years ago, <a href="https://www.socketlabs.com/">SocketLabs</a> simplifies and improves the way businesses send email with intelligent technology and personalized experiences. Incredibly, more than 600,000,000+ unique email delivery data points are analyzed by SocketLabs every day on behalf of businesses like IBM, InsRedHat, Mozilla Firefox, and The Walt Disney Company.</span></p>
                          <h2>SocketLabs needed reliable external uptime monitoring paired with accurate alerting and constant product innovation</h2>
                          <p>While SocketLabs utilizes in-house tools for the internal monitoring of application metrics and reliability – they were missing external monitoring for a holistic view into infrastructure performance. They had previously used Pingdom, but were frustrated by the constant false alarms, lack of new features, and monitoring enhancements.&nbsp;</p>
                          <p>False downtime alerts were not only a challenge to daily business operations, but to team morale. Too many false positives from a monitoring solution can cause wavering confidence, sleepless nights, and even complacency that leads to alerts being ignored. With the hope that there were better and broader uptime solutions out there – SocketLabs began their search for a new monitoring partner.</p>
                          <h2>Finding an uptime partner offering ease of use and innovative monitoring tools</h2>
                          <p>SocketLabs focuses almost entirely on email delivery and relies on a layered monitoring approach. Their customers depend on them to execute complex email strategies to mass amounts of end users. In Uptime.com, they found a monitoring partner that could play a vital role in ensuring their outward facing infrastructure is up and running as it should.&nbsp;</p>
                          <p>Upon signing up for Uptime.com's 21-day free trial, the SocketLabs dev team was delighted to find how easy the website monitoring platform was to use. This allowed them to configure a variety of monitoring checks within the first few hours of their trial.&nbsp;</p>
                          <p>As for innovation, SocketLabs began leveraging multiple private monitoring locations as a main focal point with customers who use – and rely – on their product from all over the world. This instilled team confidence in their system monitoring reliability, and helped them quickly differentiate between regional, global, or internal outages.</p>
                          <p>Today, some of SocketLabs most used monitoring features include:</p>

                            <p>That said, the instances since that <em>have</em> required support help have resulted in an immediate response from the Uptime.com team. This has left no doubt with SocketLabs that they can rely on fast 24/7 availability from Uptime.com's 100% human support team.</p>
