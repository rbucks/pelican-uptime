      <p>SocketLabs has spent 15 years perfecting the art and science of easy, reliable delivery for email. Regardless of company size or business complexity, their technology, reporting, and support resources maximize the success of email.</p>

      <h3>Solution</h3>
      <p>SocketLabs signed up for an Uptime.com 21-day free trial and immediately configured hundreds of SMTP, API, and Transaction checks within just 24 hours. They were also able to connect monitoring several integrations for evaluative purposes – quickly discovering that Uptime.com was the right uptime monitoring solution for them.</p>
      <h3>Results</h3>
      <p>Four years later, SocketLabs remains a happy Uptime.com customer that utilizes virtually every tool in Uptime.com’s monitoring solution. This includes basic and advanced checks, alert escalations, scheduled reports, status pages, private locations, and integrations.</p>

          Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
          Founded 15 years ago, <a href="https://www.socketlabs.com/">SocketLabs</a>
          simplifies and improves the way businesses send email with intelligent
          technology and personalized experiences. Incredibly, more than 600,000,000+
          unique email delivery data points are analyzed by SocketLabs every day on
          behalf of businesses like IBM, InsRedHat, Mozilla Firefox, and The Walt
          Disney Company.

      <h2>
          SocketLabs needed reliable external uptime monitoring paired with accurate
          alerting and constant product innovation
      </h2>
      <p>
          While SocketLabs utilizes in-house tools for the internal monitoring of
          application metrics and reliability – they were missing external monitoring
          for a holistic view into infrastructure performance. They had previously
          used Pingdom, but were frustrated by the constant false alarms, lack of new
          features, and monitoring enhancements.
      </p>
      <p>
          False downtime alerts were not only a challenge to daily business
          operations, but to team morale. Too many false positives from a monitoring
          solution can cause wavering confidence, sleepless nights, and even
          complacency that leads to alerts being ignored. With the hope that there
          were better and broader uptime solutions out there – SocketLabs began their
          search for a new monitoring partner.
      </p>
      <h2>
          Finding an uptime partner offering ease of use and innovative monitoring
          tools
      </h2>
      <p>
          SocketLabs focuses almost entirely on email delivery and relies on a
          layered monitoring approach. Their customers depend on them to execute
          complex email strategies to mass amounts of end users. In Uptime.com, they
          found a monitoring partner that could play a vital role in ensuring their
          outward facing infrastructure is up and running as it should.
      </p>
      <p>
          Upon signing up for Uptime.com's 21-day free trial, the SocketLabs dev team
          was delighted to find how easy the website monitoring platform was to use.
          This allowed them to configure a variety of monitoring checks within the
          first few hours of their trial.
      </p>
      <p>
          As for innovation, SocketLabs began leveraging multiple private monitoring
          locations as a main focal point with customers who use – and rely – on
          their product from all over the world. This instilled team confidence in
          their system monitoring reliability, and helped them quickly differentiate
          between regional, global, or internal outages.
