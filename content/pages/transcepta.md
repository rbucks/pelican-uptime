          Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
          Since 2005, the world's most respected companies have partnered with
          Transcepta for eProcurement and accounts payable automation to make
          informed, data-driven decisions, and drive increased profits.

      <h2>
          Transcepta Required Accurate and Immediate Infrastructure Monitoring after
          COVID-19
      </h2>
      <p>
          For countless technology companies, COVID-19 was a watershed moment.
          Accelerated demand -- for

          >
              digital transformation
          </a>
          was the case for <a href="https://www.transcepta.com/">Transcepta</a>, a
          leading procure-to-pay platform used by thousands of businesses like
          Sprint, Raytheon, and 7-Eleven. Transcepta experienced unprecedented growth
          thanks to new enterprise demand for the automation of their processes,
          workflows, and large-scale operations.
      </p>
      <p>
          While the opportunity to capitalize and quickly add major new clients was
          incredible for Transcepta's business -- this momentum created a need for a
          good external monitoring tool to use in tandem to what the company was
          already using in-house. Transcepta suddenly found themselves onboarding
          larger enterprises who wanted third-party validations of the Transcepta
          Portal's availability, including SSO login access to their
          <a href="https://supplier1.transcepta.com/SupplierPortal/login">
              buyer portal
          </a>
          . Utilizing Uptime.com's solution, Transcepta was able to provide that
          third-party validation. As an added benefit, Transcetpa's Operations Team
          now gets Uptime.com alert notifications whenever portal access performance
          falls outside of preset thresholds. This helps Transcepta resolve issues
          before customers ever see them.
      </p>
      <p>
          Ultimately, Transcepta needed monitoring peace of mind -- ASAP. They chose
          Uptime.com as their infrastructure monitoring partner due to our:
      </p>

      </ol>
      <h2>
          Technology + Support Means True Partnership for Transcepta
      </h2>
      <p>
          Transcepta, in their mission to "automate everything" suddenly saw their
          market demand skyrocket when COVID-19 accelerated the need for digital
          transformation across the board.
      </p>
      <p>
          With Uptime.com, Transcepta found more than a monitoring vendor -- they
          found a partner and extension of their own system infrastructure team.
          While other vendors employ bots or take weeks to respond to issues --
          Uptime.com's support experts are a true difference-maker in their
          monitoring success.
      </p>
      <h2>
          A Powerful Monitoring Solution That’s Easy-to-Use and Work With
      </h2>
      <p>
          Transcepta quickly found Uptime.com's monitoring system easy to configure.
          Simple account and check setup was critical to Transcepta’s System
          Engineering Managers, who configured various monitoring checks without
          needing technical support.
      </p>
      <p>
          For critical checks with more complex configurations, Transcepta benefitted
          from expert partnership with Uptime.com's technical support team. Together,
          Uptime.com and Transcepta set up synthetic monitoring to continuously check
          their buyer portal. This check alone has made a difference for Transcepta's
          IT and System Insights Teams to know if portals are unresponsive within
          preset timelines -- and get to the root cause faster than ever.

              Uptime.com's support is the key difference-maker for us. Compared to
              other vendors in the web monitoring industry (and beyond) who might
              have you talk to a bot or wait 6-7 days to respond -- your
              responsiveness and actual helpfulness are truly unique
