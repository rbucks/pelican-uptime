          Epurple Required Automated Detecting and Alerting of Downtime Events
      </h2>
      <p>
          Epurple clients were reporting downtime issues before they could even be
          detected, leaving employees in a constantly reactive state. The limited
          bandwidth of Epurple's team makes proactively discovering and resolving
          downtime events a challenge – both for employees and customers. Epurple
          chose Uptime.com as their web monitoring partner thanks to our:

          Uptime.com's Excellent Service Helps Epurple Better Service Their Customers
      </h2>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
          Uptime.com's solution helps Epurple achieve these objectives by providing
          around the clock downtime and performance monitoring. Epurple has been
          using Uptime.com some time now to monitor critical endpoints for downtime
          response. In short, Uptime.com consistently puts Epurple in the best

      <p>
          Epurple found Uptime.com setup very easy to
          use. Both their account setup and single
          monitoring check setups were straightforward
          and simple to implement. Without any help from
          Uptime.com support, they've configured

              all sorts of monitoring checks
          </a>
          for their customers.

          "At Epurple, we want our clients to feel like
          we are 'on top of it' and that we see and know
          everything. When Uptime.com identifies problems
          such as string match errors, and sends us SMS
          alerts, we get that first response capability
          we're looking for."

              the escalation process
          </a>
          is very easy to set up. For instance, Epurple
          employees receive email and SMS notifications
          when downtime is discovered. Finally, they like
          the fact that they're able to adjust the check
          interval, locations, contacts and escalations
          (additional contacts when a website is down for
          x time) for each client. This allows Epurple to

          >
              customize all the checks
          </a>
          they use – and therefore the alerts their team
          receives are always a sign that action is
          required. Thanks to this, Epurple employees
          don't need to worry about receiving alerts in
          the middle of the night while there is actually
          nothing going on.
