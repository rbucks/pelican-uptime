                          <h2>Epurple Required Automated Detecting and Alerting of Downtime Events</h2>
                          <p><span>Epurple clients were reporting downtime issues before they could even be detected, leaving employees in a constantly reactive state. The limited bandwidth of Epurple's team makes proactively discovering and resolving downtime events a challenge – both for employees and customers. Epurple chose Uptime.com as their web monitoring partner thanks to our:</span></p>

                            <li>Moment-it-happens response capabilities over downtime issues</li>
                          </ul>
                          <h2>Uptime.com's Excellent Service Helps Epurple Better Service Their Customers</h2>

                          <h2>Easy setup, Automation, and Reliability</h2>
                          <div id="customers-success-page">
                            <div>
                              <div>
                                <div>
                                  <div>
                                    <div>
                                      <div>
                                        <p>Epurple found Uptime.com setup very easy to use. Both their account setup and single monitoring check setups were straightforward and simple to implement. Without any help from Uptime.com support, they've configured <a href="https://support.uptime.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002533889-Overview-of-Checks" rel="noopener">all sorts of monitoring checks</a> for their customers.</p>
                                        <p>"At Epurple, we want our clients to feel like we are 'on top of it' and that we see and know everything. When Uptime.com identifies problems such as string match errors, and sends us SMS alerts, we get that first response capability we're looking for."</p>
                                        <p>Additionally, <a href="https://support.uptime.com/hc/en-us/articles/360005117559-Creating-Responsive-Escalations-for-Downtime-Alerting" rel="noopener">the escalation process</a> is very easy to set up. For instance, Epurple employees receive email and SMS notifications when downtime is discovered. Finally, they like the fact that they're able to adjust the check interval, locations, contacts and escalations (additional contacts when a website is down for x time) for each client. This allows Epurple to <a href="https://support.uptime.com/hc/en-us/articles/360014269679-Custom-Checks-for-Process-Monitoring" rel="noopener">customize all the checks</a> they use – and therefore the alerts their team receives are always a sign that action is required. Thanks to this, Epurple employees don't need to worry about receiving alerts in the middle of the night while there is actually nothing going on.</p>
