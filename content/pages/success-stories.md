  "NRC was looking for a monitoring tool to replace the one we currently had. We used PINGDOM, DataDog, PRTG, and other services during our initial review. We ended up choosing uptime! Their customer service was very polite and fast. Their interface was very easy and user friendly. Their knowledge base articles also helped out a lot as we had questions. Most of all they give you the proper bang for your buck!")}}
