        Condeco DevOps Required Observability
      </h2>
      <p>
        Condeco DevOps oversees both single and multi-tenant solutions hosted in
        Azure with more than 1,000 customers accessing services in a multitude of
        ways. There are also hardware components used by web pages and API calls.
        The team's needs included increased observability to enable a proactive
        approach to downtime resolution.
      </p>
      <p>
        In evaluating monitoring solutions, Condeco requirements were as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Gain first-response capabilities over outages
        </li>
        <li>
          Flexible notification system to report downtime where the team lives
          and works
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="/api/v1/docs/?hsLang=en">API access</a>
          to implement auto-heal logic, create checks and expedite monitoring at
          scale
        </li>

          <a href="/status-page?hsLang=en">

      </ul>

        In evaluating service providers, Condeco recognized
        <a

          rel="noopener"
          >
        Uptime.com's powerful API
        </a>
        and intuitive user interface. These qualities made the two partners a
        natural fit.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Rapid Deployment with Visibility and Oversight
      </h2>
      <p>
        Condeco's infrastructure is growing rapidly, the sign of a bright future
        for the company. That bright future requires underlying oversight of that
        infrastructure. Along with the existing monitoring, the company needed a
        system that could grow alongside their own business.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using Uptime.com, Condeco's inbound support tickets related to outages are
        reduced and Condeco's customers are more aware of planned maintenance and
        expected downtime. In addition, the team gains greater insight into their
        existing services for a clearer understanding of performance bottlenecks
        for resource allocation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Condeco relies on
        <a
          href="https://support.uptime.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001311589-API-Check-Basics"
          >
        Uptime.com API checks
        </a>
        to monitor critical endpoints for downtime response. Uptime.com's SLA
        reporting provides the reassurance Condeco needs in upholding its
        agreements, and ultimately providing the best possible user experience. In
        addition, maintenance mode allows the company to safely provide upgrades
        and improvements to strengthen infrastructure without confusing alerts and
        invalid downtime muddling reports.

        Uptime and Condeco | Continually Providing the Best Possibly User
        Experience
      </h2>
      <p>
        Businesses around the world rely on Condeco
        scheduling tools to coordinate workplace
        coverage. Downtime can bring work to a halt.
        When reliability became imperative, Condeco
        relied on Uptime.com.
      </p>
      <p>
        Uptime.com reporting gave Condeco the tools
        needed not just to respond to downtime, but to
        learn and grow from these events. The company
        has better data on performance and outages to
        make informed data-driven decisions as they
        scale.
      </p>
      <p>
        Downtime-related tickets saw a noticeable
        decline once the company adopted Uptime.com
        monitoring, as teams took a more proactive
        approach to incident management.
